**(0:00 - 0:30) Intro & The "Why"**
"Hi, I'm Vino. We all know chatbots are great, but they lack *intuition*. They don't know if I'm an angry customer or a million-dollar lead. Today, I present **AION-CX 360°**—the first AI Revenue OS for Zoho SalesIQ that gives your agents 'Superpowers'."

**(0:30 - 1:00) The Bot Experience (Visitor View)**
*Action: Open Chat Window.*
"Watch this. I'm a visitor. I type: 'I'm looking for an enterprise solution for 500 seats.'
*Action: Bot replies.*
"Notice the bot didn't just say 'Hello'. It detected my **Intent** (Buying) and **Scale** (Enterprise). It instantly shifted its persona to 'Enterprise Consultant' and asked relevant qualifying questions. It's not following a tree; it's following the *context*."

**(1:00 - 1:45) The Operator Experience (Widget View)**
*Action: Switch to Operator Console.*
"Now, let's look at the Agent's view. This is the **AION Intelligence Widget**.
Look at this!
*   **Lead Score**: 95/100 (Hot).
*   **Emotion**: 'Urgent'.
*   **AI Advice**: 'Offer the Q4 Enterprise Discount'.
The AI is literally coaching me on how to close this deal live. I can even click 'Generate Email' to draft a follow-up instantly."

**(1:45 - 2:30) The Executive Dashboard (Manager View)**
*Action: Switch to Dashboard.*
"For managers, we have the **Command Center**.
Here I can see my entire pipeline in real-time.
*   Live Leads flowing in.
*   Revenue Predictions based on AI scoring.
*   I can drag and drop this lead to 'Qualified', and boom—it syncs to Zoho CRM automatically."

**(2:30 - 3:00) Conclusion**
"AION-CX 360° bridges the gap between Chat, CRM, and AI. It turns conversations into revenue. Thank you."
